###### Example Thread Channel

[Threads](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS) can be either `archived` or `active`.  Archived threads are generally immutable.  To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived.  The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Unlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view.  When receiving a [guild create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view.  Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel.  As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel the API sends a [thread list sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.

Threads also track membership.  Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them.  The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Guilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread.  Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added.  Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.

The [threads](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS) topic has some more information.

### Message Object

Represents a message sent in a channel within Discord.

###### Message Structure

> info
> Fields specific to the `MESSAGE_CREATE` and `MESSAGE_UPDATE` events are listed in the [Gateway documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/message-create).

> warn
> `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, `components`, and `poll` require the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-content-intent) to receive non-empty values.

\* The author object follows the structure of the user object, but is only a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a user or bot user. If the message is generated by a webhook, the author object corresponds to the webhook's id, username, and avatar. You can tell if a message is generated by a webhook by checking for the `webhook_id` on the message object.

\*\* An app will receive empty values in the `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` fields if they have not configured (or been approved for) the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` privileged intent (`1 << 15`)](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-content-intent).

\*\*\* Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

\*\*\*\* This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `19` (REPLY) or `21` (THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE). If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is null, the referenced message was deleted.


###### Message Types

> warn
> Type `19` and `20` are only available in API v8 and above. In v6, they are represented as type `0`.  Additionally, type `21` is only available in API v9 and above.

| fail_if_not_exists? | boolean   | when sending, whether to error if the referenced message doesn't exist instead of sending as a normal (non-reply) message, default true |

\* `channel_id` is optional when creating a reply, but will always be present when receiving an event/response that includes this data model.

#### Message Types

There are multiple message types that have a message_reference object.  Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.

###### Crosspost messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (IS_CROSSPOST flag).
- These messages have all three fields, which point to the original message that was crossposted.

###### Channel Follow Add messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type 12).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, which point to the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type 6).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, which point to the message that was pinned.

###### Replies

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type 19).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, which point to the message that was replied to. The channel_id and guild_id will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a message_reference when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.

###### Thread Created messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a public thread is created from an old message or without a message (type 18).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, which point to the created thread channel.

###### Thread starter messages

- These are the first message in public threads created from messages. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started. (type 21)
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages will never have content, embeds, or attachments, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

#### Voice Messages

Voice messages are messages with the `IS_VOICE_MESSAGE` flag. They have the following properties.

- They cannot be edited.
- Only a single audio attachment is allowed. No content, stickers, etc...
- The [attachment](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/attachment-object) has additional fields: `duration_secs` and `waveform`.

The `waveform` is intended to be a preview of the entire voice message, with 1 byte per datapoint encoded in base64. Clients sample the recording at most
once per 100 milliseconds, but will downsample so that no more than 256 datapoints are in the waveform.

As of 2023-04-14, clients upload a 1 channel, 48000 Hz, 32kbps Opus stream in an OGG container.
The encoding, and the waveform details, are an implementation detail and may change without warning or documentation.

###### Embed Limits

To facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:

All of the following limits are measured inclusively. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are not included (they are trimmed automatically).

| Field                                                                      | Limit                                                                                |

Additionally, the combined sum of characters in all `title`, `description`, `field.name`, `field.value`, `footer.text`, and `author.name` fields across all embeds attached to a message must not exceed 6000 characters. Violating any of these constraints will result in a `Bad Request` response.

Embeds are deduplicated by URL.  If a message contains multiple embeds with the same URL, only the first is shown.

### Allowed Mentions Object

The allowed mention field allows for more granular control over mentions without various hacks to the message content. This will always validate against message content to avoid phantom pings (e.g. to ping everyone, you must still have `@everyone` in the message content), and check against user/bot permissions.

###### Allowed Mention Types

| Type              | Value      | Description                           |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Role Mentions     | "roles"    | Controls role mentions                |
| User Mentions     | "users"    | Controls user mentions                |
| Everyone Mentions | "everyone" | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

###### Allowed Mentions Reference

Due to the complexity of possibilities, we have included a set of examples and behavior for the allowed mentions field.

If `allowed_mentions` is _not_ passed in (i.e. the key does not exist), the mentions will be parsed via the content. This corresponds with existing behavior.

In the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"
}
```

To suppress all mentions in a message use:

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```

This will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).

The `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a `Falsy` value ([], null) into the "users" field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

In the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed
@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Because `parse: ["users"]` and `users: [123, 124]` are both present, we would throw a validation error.
This is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).

Any entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message's content will simply be ignored.
e.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of
user 125 in the content.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "125"]
  }
}
```

### Role Subscription Data Object

###### Role Subscription Data Object Structure

| Field                        | Type      | Description                                                           |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| role_subscription_listing_id | snowflake | the id of the sku and listing that the user is subscribed to          |
| tier_name                    | string    | the name of the tier that the user is subscribed to                   |
| total_months_subscribed      | integer   | the cumulative number of months that the user has been subscribed for |
| is_renewal                   | boolean   | whether this notification is for a renewal rather than a new purchase |

## Get Channel % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}

Get a channel by ID. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.  If the channel is a thread, a [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object is included in the returned result.

## Modify Channel % PATCH /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}

Update a channel's settings. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. All JSON parameters are optional.

> info
> This endpoint supports the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header.

###### JSON Params (Group DM)

Fires a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-update) Gateway event.

| Field | Type   | Description                  |
|-------|--------|------------------------------|
| name  | string | 1-100 character channel name |
| icon  | binary | base64 encoded icon          |

###### JSON Params (Guild channel)

Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. Fires a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes. If modifying permission overwrites, the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission is required. Only permissions your bot has in the guild or parent channel (if applicable) can be allowed/denied (unless your bot has a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel).

For stage channels, bitrate can be set up to 64000.

\*\* In each overwrite object, the `allow` and `deny` keys can be omitted or set to `null`, which both default to `"0"`.

###### JSON Params (Thread)

When setting `archived` to `false`, when `locked` is also `false`, only the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is required.

Otherwise, requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission. Fires a [Thread Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/thread-update) Gateway event. Requires the thread to have `archived` set to `false` or be set to `false` in the request.

## Delete/Close Channel % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}

Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-delete) Gateway event (or [Thread Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/thread-delete) if the channel was a thread).

> warn
> Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.

> info
> For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.

> info
> This endpoint supports the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header.

## Get Channel Messages % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages

Retrieves the messages in a channel. Returns an array of [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) objects on success.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the current user to have the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission. If the channel is a voice channel, they must _also_ have the `CONNECT` permission.

If the current user is missing the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel, then no messages will be returned.

> info
> The `before`, `after`, and `around` parameters are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.

###### Query String Params

| around? | snowflake | Get messages around this message ID      | absent  |
| before? | snowflake | Get messages before this message ID      | absent  |
| after?  | snowflake | Get messages after this message ID       | absent  |
| limit?  | integer   | Max number of messages to return (1-100) | 50      |

## Get Channel Message % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}

Retrieves a specific message in the channel. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object on success.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the current user to have the `VIEW_CHANNEL` and `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permissions. If the channel is a voice channel, they must _also_ have the `CONNECT` permission.

## Create Message % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages

> warn
> Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.

Post a message to a guild text or DM channel. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

To create a message as a reply to another message, apps can include a [`message_reference`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-reference-object-message-reference-structure) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](#DOCS_REFERENCE/uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
    - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **25 MiB**
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

###### JSON/Form Params

> info
> When creating a message, apps must provide a value for **at least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `sticker_ids`, `components`, `files[n]`, or `poll`.

When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying. Only `flags` documented in the table below may be modified by users (unsupported flag changes are currently ignored without error).

When the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Does not work on a [`GUILD_FORUM`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/start-thread-in-forum-or-media-channel) or a `GUILD_MEDIA` channel. The id of the created thread will be the same as the id of the source message, and as such a message can only have a single thread created from it.

- The type of the created thread is `PUBLIC_THREAD`.
- See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.
- The current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission (`CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS` is ignored).
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **25 MiB**.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.
- Examples for file uploads are available in [Uploading Files](#DOCS_REFERENCE/uploading-files).
- Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](#DOCS_REFERENCE/uploading-files).
- Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at **least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `sticker_ids`, `components`, or `files[n]`.
